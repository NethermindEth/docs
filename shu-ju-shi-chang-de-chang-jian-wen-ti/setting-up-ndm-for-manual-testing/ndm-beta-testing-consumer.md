## Making deposit and getting the data

After that, you will have an electron app and cosnole running. By default, you will have our Provider node added in the static-nodes file so you will be already connected to one. If you don't see any data assets - don't worry, they will appear after a while.

You will see a couple of data assets. For example **Crypto Compare Web Api** or **Nethermind Tx Stream**.

* [x] Continue by placing a deposit with the unit number of your choice.

* [x] After you make a deposit go to the **Deposits** tab.&#x20;

When the deposit is unclonfirmed, please wait patiently for block confirmations.

Once the deposit has been confirmaed, feel free to **open a data stream**.
