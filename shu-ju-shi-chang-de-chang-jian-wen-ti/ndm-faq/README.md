# 常见问题

## What is NDM?

Nethermind Data Marketplace is a protocol that creates a subnetwork within Ethereum to handle data delivery directly between parties who are running NDM-supporting nodes. NDM allows data consumers to discover data providers and uses a smart contract to facilitate on-chain, secure payments in exchange for data. The unique built-in reputation and data delivery protocol minimizes the amount of on-chain transactions.

## Where can I download NDM?

You can download up to date packages on [Nethermind downloads page](https://downloads.nethermind.io/).

## Is NDM a finished project?

No, we are constantly working on the final version.

NDM is currently available in **beta**. Due to the fact that this is not the final version, please contact us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/zZC8CthuzA) if you have any problems.

## What are the risks of using a beta version of NDM?

Most risks come with refunds and payment claims, so please be aware that there may be some issues with processing transactions. With that in mind, **keep your logs** and **database** and if anything unexpected happens, get in touch with out team via [discord](https://discord.com/invite/zZC8CthuzA) or contact tab in NDM application.

## Do I need to wait for sync and how long?

Yes, but don't worry everything is prepared. With the package you will get ready to use configs. After run NDM, you will be asked to select the client type (consumer or provider) and then type of the network. After that the sync will start.

* Ethereum testnets estimated time depends on the network type - 1 to several hours.
