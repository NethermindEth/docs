Nethermind has a pre-packed `Nethermind.HealthChecks.dll` plugin that allows you to monitor your Nethermind node better.
It leverages the power
of [AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks). It simply adds
an`/health`endpoint to the JSON RPC service which can be used to check the Nethermind's _**liveness** -_ verify if the
node is **synced** and has **at least one peer.** Useful when you don't want to query the node before it's able to
provide you data available only for fully synced nodes like `eth_getBalance`.

The `Nethermind.HealthChecks.dll`plugin will be automatically loaded on Nethermind start.

## Enabling and configuring Health Checks

The health checks need to be additionally enabled which can be done either through `--HealthChecks.*` flags or by adding
a `"HealthChecks"` section to the config file.&#x20;

``` json title="HealthChecks config section example" 
  "HealthChecks": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "WebhooksEnabled": true,
    "WebhooksUri": "https://slack.webhook",
    "UIEnabled": true,
    "PollingInterval": 10,
    "Slug": "/api/health"
  }
```

:::danger
JSON RPC Service needs to be enabled in order for health checks to work `--JsonRpc.Enabled true`
:::

Each configuration option is described [here](../fundamentals/configuration#healthchecks).

#### Enabling Health Checks without UI&#x20;

```bash
./Nethermind.Runner --HealthChecks.Enabled true
```

The `health` endpoint is now available at `localhost:8545/health`  by default (if your `--JsonRpc.Port` is `8545`).
The `health` endpoint can be configured via `--HealthChecks.Slug` parameter e.g. `--HealthChecks.Slug /api/health`. We
can if it is working with `curl`:

```bash
// Request
curl localhost:8545/health

// Example of response for Unhealthy node
{"status":"Unhealthy","totalDuration":"00:00:00.0015582","entries":{"node-health":{"data":{},"description":"The node has 0 peers connected","duration":"00:00:00.0003881","status":"Unhealthy","tags":[]}}}

// Example of response for Healthy node
{"status":"Healthy","totalDuration":"00:00:00.0015582","entries":{"node-health":{"data":{},"description":"The node is now fully synced with a network, number of peers: 99","duration":"00:00:00.0003881","status":"Healthy","tags":[]}}}
```

:::info

* **Unhealthy** returns **503** (Service Unavailable) status code
:::

:::info
* **Healthy** returns **200** status code
:::

#### Enabling Health Checks UI

```bash
./Nethermind.Runner --HealthChecks.Enabled true --HealthChecks.UIEnabled true
```

Enabling UI will expose an additional endpoint `/healthchecks-ui`and will allow seeing node's health on a nice UI. To
view the UI simply go to `http://localhost:8545/healthchecks-ui`.

#### Enabling Slack reports

We may also add Slack Webhook endpoint to which our node's health will be reported. We need to pass
the `--HealthChecks.WebhooksEnabled true` and add the `--HealthChecks.WebhooksUri` which can be found in your Slack app
configuration.

```bash
nethermind --HealthChecks.Enabled true --HealthChecks.UIEnabled true --HealthChecks.WebhooksEnabled true --HealthChecks.WebhooksUri https://hooks.slack.com/
```

If your node will be **Unhealthy** you should receive a message similar to this:

![Unhealthy](/img/unhealthy.png)

with description of why the node is unhealthy, node's name and information about the machine on which the node is
running.\
When it becomes **Healthy** (**synced** and with **peers**) you should receive:

![Healthy](</img/image(46).png>)

#### Consensus Client health

This check verifies if the client receives messages from the CL. If you see this warning in your logs, it means that
there is something wrong with CL/Nethermind communication. Check more about setting up Nethermind and
CL [here](../get-started/consensus-clients.md).

```
No incoming messages from Consensus Client. Consensus Client is required to sync the node. Please make sure that it's working properly.
```

:::warning
Note that Consensus Client is required for normal node operations.

#### health\_nodeStatus

Health checks via JSON RPC requests were introduced in version v.1.10.18. For that,  `HealthChecks.Enabled` should be
set to true.

<TabItem value="request" label="Request">


```

```

</TabItem>

            "No messages from CL"
        ],
        "errors": [
            "SyncDegraded",
            "ClUnavailable"
        ],

    },

#### Monitoring available storage space

Feature which is helping to track free disk space is enabled by default and monitors a drive which has been used to
configure database location. There are two new configuration options available:

* `--HealthChecks.LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold` - Percentage of free disk space below which a warning will be
  displayed. If Health Checks UI is enabled, it will also be reported under node's health. Default value is 5 - meaning
  5% of free disk space.
* `--HealthChecks.LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold` - Percentage of available disk space below which node will shutdown
  to avoid database corruption. Default value is 1 - meaning 1% of free disk space.

```bash
nethermind --HealthChecks.LowStorageSpaceWarningThreshold 5 --HealthChecks.LowStorageSpaceShutdownThreshold 1
```

#### HealthChecks for producing and processing blocks

There are two fields for HealthChecks config: MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock and MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock. The
node will return unhealthy status if the interval elapsed without processing or producing a block. Let's use the below
config as an example. If the node doesn't process a block for 15 seconds, we will return unhealthy status. Analogically,
we will be waiting 45 seconds for a newly produced block.

``` json title="HealthChecks config section example" 

  "HealthChecks": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "WebhooksEnabled": true,
    "UIEnabled": true,
    "Slug": "/api/health",
    "MaxIntervalWithoutProcessedBlock ": 15,
    "MaxIntervalWithoutProducedBlock": 45
  }
```

If those fields are not set in a config, application will try to use them based on seal engine specification. If there
is infinite time, unhealthy status can still be reported if processing or producing threads stopped.
