This guide will walk you through using [Kurtosis `ethereum-package`](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package) to spin up a private, proof-of-stake (PoS) Ethereum devnet with three full Ethereum nodes locally over Docker. At the end of the guide, you will learn how to scale up your testnet on Kubernetes as well as enable optional services for your local testnet, such as network observability tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus) and Flashbot's `mev-boost` infrastructure to simulate MEV workflows.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Kurtosis CLI](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) installed. The [`ethereum-package`](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package) is a Kurtosis environment definition known as a [package](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/packages). For more info about Kurtosis, see the [Kurtosis docs](https://docs.kurtosis.com).

## Step 2: Configure your network

Next, in your home directory, create a file with the name `network_params.json` and populate it with the following contents:

```json title="network_params.json"
{
  "participants": [
    {
      "el_client_type": "nethermind",
      "el_client_image": "nethermind/nethermind:latest",
      "cl_client_type": "lighthouse",
      "cl_client_image": "sigp/lighthouse:latest",
      "count": 1
    },
    {
      "el_client_type": "nethermind",
      "el_client_image": "nethermind/nethermind:latest",
      "cl_client_type": "teku",
      "cl_client_image": "consensys/teku:latest",
      "count": 1
    },
    {
      "el_client_type": "nethermind",
      "el_client_image": "nethermind/nethermind:latest",
      "cl_client_type": "lodestar",
      "cl_client_image": "chainsafe/lodestar:next",
      "count": 1
    }
  ],
  "mev_type": "None",
  "launch_additional_services": false
}
```

As you can see above, you have effectively created a network configuration file that Kurtosis will use to pass in the necessary parameters at runtime for your network. Notice that the `participant` key describes the execution and consensus client pairing desired for each full node and how many nodes of that type to instantiate.

There are many other configurations and flags you can use, including metrics and observability tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus, etc). For all supported options, see the `ethereum-package` [configuration](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package#configuration).

## Step 3: Deploy

Finally, once you have saved the `network_params.json` file, it is time to deploy the private net:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package "$(cat ~/network_params.json)"
```

Kurtosis will use the `ethereum-package` environment definition and your custom network configuration (defined in `network_params.json`) to spin up your network. Kurtosis will first spin up an [enclave][enclaves] (i.e., an ephemeral, isolated environment) and begin to configure and instantiate the nodes in your network. In the end, Kurtosis will print the services running in your enclave that form your private testnet alongside all the container ports and files that were generated and used to start up the private testnet.

Here is a sample output:

```

And that is it! You now have a 3-node, private Ethereum devnet with Nethermind/Lodestar, Nethermind/Teku, and Nethermind/Lighthouse execution and consensus client combinations.

Notice how, at the end, Kurtosis will print out the contents of your enclave, which includes both the various [files artifacts](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/files-artifacts) and services that form your network. Kurtosis also maps the container ports to ephemeral local ports on your machine.

Genesis data was generated using this [genesis-generator](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator) to bootstrap the execution and consensus clients for each node. The end result will be a private testnet with nodes deployed as Docker containers in an ephemeral, isolated environment on your machine called an [enclave][enclaves].

Kurtosis packages are modular, reproducible, and will work over Docker or Kubernetes. Read on to learn about additional services and configurations you may want to add to your private network.

## Step 4: Optional workflows

This section briefly covers some optional configurations for your private devnet that are commonly used for validating and testing node-level behavior.

### Simulating MEV workflows with `mev-boost`

The `ethereum-package` can simulate out-of-protocol Proposer Builder Separation (PBS) workflows using Flashbot's `mev-boost` infrastructure. With a single flag, you can configure your network's validators to be instantiated with `mev-boost` and be registered with a relayer to receive payloads from builders.

To enable this in your `network_params.json` file, set `"mev_type":` to `"full"` or `"mock"`.

To learn more about how the `mev-boost` infrastructure works with your private network, check out [this guide](https://docs.kurtosis.com/how-to-full-mev-with-ethereum-package).

### Observability tools

The `ethereum-package` comes out of the box with a few observability tools, including:

- A Grafana and Prometheus instance
- A [beacon metrics gazer service](https://github.com/dapplion/beacon-metrics-gazer) to collect network-wide participation metrics
- A [JSON-RPC Snooper](https://github.com/ethDreamer/json_rpc_snoop) to log responses & requests between the execution engine API and the consensus client

To add your own custom Grafana dashboard template, fork the `ethereum-package` repository and add your configuration [here](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package/tree/main/static_files/grafana-config/dashboards).

### Deploying on Kubernetes

As mentioned earlier, Kurtosis packages (i.e. environment definitions) are portable and will work the same way over Docker or on Kubernetes. Should you require a larger scale devnet, Kurtosis can deploy any package, including the `ethereum-package` on Kubernetes, see [Running Kurtosis in Kubernetes](https://docs.kurtosis.com/k8s).
